This is a program I completed after reading chapter 7 (a deeper look).
This program is created to help a elementary-school student learn multiplication.
After the student answers a question right they will be prompted with a new question
continuesly, if the student gets the answer wrong they will have an infinite amount
of chances to input the correct answer.

the biggest take aways from this chapter that I didn't already know was a
deeper look into static methods and static variables and what that word actually
means how static methods are methods only opperate on its arguments and not dependent
on an object I never thought about that. this chapter covered random number generator
and enums i've read about enums once but i've never used them myself.

How to use:
Upon running the program you will be prompted with a multiplication question
type in your answer if it is correct very good will be printed along with a new question.
